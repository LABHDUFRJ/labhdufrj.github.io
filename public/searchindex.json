  "content":"\rTable of Contents Data Mining for Digital Humanities Analysis of Multi-Platform Ecosystems of Disinformation and Radicalization through Telegram Digital History Ethical, Social, and Political Implications of Digital Technoscience The Economy of Affectionate Exchanges: Market, Socialities, and Digital Media Data Mining for Digital Humanities The acquisition of computational skills in research practice across various fields of the humanities is one of the pillars of what is being called Digital Humanities. Currently, a multitude of digital tools are available that assist in the extraction and assembly of databases, in the analysis and interpretation of this material, and finally, in the organization and dissemination of results. LABHDUFRJ develops data extraction algorithms for the web and digital social networks. Furthermore, it aims to provide critical reflection on how these digital tools may represent new ways of structuring imagination and investigations in different humanities fields, requiring us to evaluate \u0026lsquo;how far it is possible to think\u0026rsquo; within the logics that structure these algorithms.\nAnalysis of Multi-Platform Ecosystems of Disinformation and Radicalization through Telegram This project establishes a multi-method framework to map and analyze the multi-platform ecosystem of political extremism networks through the Telegram app. It monitors computational propaganda activities, coordinated influence operations, and hate speech (misogyny, racism, LGBTQIA+phobia) using corpus linguistics (CL), natural language processing (NLP), discourse analysis, and online ethnography.\nBack to top Digital History Research in the field of Digital History has been developed in direct partnership between LABHDUFRJ and the undergraduate History program of the University for International Integration of Afro-Brazilian Lusophony, Malês campus. We aim to develop empirical research and theoretical discussions based on digitized documentary collections archived in online repositories. The goal is to produce methodological reflections through the use of digital tools that enable new historiographical approaches and the construction of new historical problems for research, teaching, and writing. These reflections seek to directly engage with debates on race, racism, and rights in the Americas. Currently, we work together on the assessment, creation, and enhancement of research tools for historical research, especially R and Python scripts for internet data scraping (web scraping).\nBack to top Ethical, Social, and Political Implications of Digital Technoscience Understanding the ethical, social, and political implications of new digital practices has become an urgent mission of the social sciences in contemporary times. Through the integration of conceptual and methodological frameworks from Digital Humanities and Studies on Science, Technology, and Society (STS), our team seeks to generate reflections that contribute to understanding the co-production between Digital Technoscience and social, political, and cultural transformations in Brazil. Digital Technoscience, in our conception, refers not only to the practices and knowledge embedded in the complex networks of hardware, software, and humans involved in the production of knowledge about computing and digital technology but also to the entanglement of these networks with various dimensions of social life. Through digital ethnographies and the use of mixed methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis of web-scraped data, LABHDUFRJ conducts case studies that support reflections on the co-production between the digital order and social life, as well as on the opportunities and risks involved with innovations in digital platforms. Currently, research has focused on dimensions such as: post-truth and digital populism, digital activism and democracy, regulation, and data accountability.\nBack to top The Economy of Affectionate Exchanges: Market, Socialities, and Digital Media The dominance of affective relationships surrounding the constitution of a symbolic social field, coupled with the analysis of recent shifts in relation to structures and practices, brought about by the advent of new digital media, particularly in the migration from old websites to contemporary dating apps. As lines are drawn on the development and promotion of these new affective-sexual dynamics, empirical investigation stems from the conception of consumption established through technological mediation, as well as the consequent transformation of users into commodities available within this affective market, primarily through online services. The emergence of the proposed sociological debate revolves around the incessant production of digital data by users and developing companies, through the articulation between networked social actors and these devices, as new relational spaces, as well as at the intersection between various changes in the realm of affectivity and gender and sexuality relations.\nBack to top "},{

The goal was to serve as a reference base and information hub for the dissemination of knowledge in the digital environment aimed at researchers in the field of Information Science (interested in the topic of Digital Humanities) and humanities in general in the Portuguese language.\nStarting from 2020, the Larhud Wiki now has the partnership of the Digital Humanities Laboratory at UFBA (LABHD-UFBA), becoming the Wiki of tutorials for digital humanities tools from these two laboratories!\nThe wiki is entirely in Portuguese, with a glossary and a list of the most commonly used tools for research in digital humanities.\nLearn More Under development\rWe are actively working on creating and refining new tools and features.
